Fireside

An application created in order to bridge the gap between intergenerational friendships. 

Our objective with this app was to bring together various generations, who are randomly matched with the 'opposite' age group, in order to help one another. Baby boomers and beyond can get help from the younger generation for whatever they require,including but not limited to platonic companionship, gift ideas and so on.  In return, the younger generation can recieve life advice, the knowledge they've done a good deed, while also fufilling their need for companionship. 

This was built out using React, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and SASS.
